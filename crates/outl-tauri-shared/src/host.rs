//! The traits that absorb the desktop ↔ mobile structural divergence.
//!
//! The only real difference between the two `src-tauri` backends is how
//! the storage root is held: the desktop can swap workspaces at runtime
//! (`Arc<Mutex<Option<PathBuf>>>`), the mobile resolves one folder at boot
//! (`PathBuf`; switching is a relaunch). Everything else the shared
//! command bodies need is uniform and exposed through [`AppHost`].

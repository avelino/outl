/**
 * Bridge between the Solid editor and the native UIKit ref suggester
 * (the chip strip docked above the formatting toolbar; see
 * `main.mm` → `OutlSuggestView` / `OutlAccessoryContainer`).
 *
 * The contract is **state-based, not message-based**: JS owns a
 * single global `window.__outlSuggesterState` that UIKit polls every
 * 150ms while the keyboard is up. We tried `WKScriptMessageHandler`
 * first but the Tauri-managed `WKUserContentController` did not
 * surface late-added handlers reliably — silent loss was worse than
 * a tiny polling cost.
 *
 * - JS calls [`setNativeSuggesterState`] when the caret enters or
 *   leaves an open `[[…]]` reference.
 * - UIKit reads it on the next poll tick and updates the chip strip.
 * - Tap on a chip calls back via `window.__outlSuggesterPicked(slug,
 *   kind)`.
 *
 * Desktop dev (`bun run dev` without a webview) just sets the global
 * — UIKit isn't there to read it, but Solid keeps the visual editor
 * consistent.

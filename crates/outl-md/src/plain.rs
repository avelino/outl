//! Flattening inline markup down to the prose a human reads.

//! The counterpart to `inline::inline_to_source`: that one reconstructs
//! the markdown verbatim, this one throws the syntax away and keeps the
//! words. Built for notification bodies, and equally right for a11y
//! labels, plain-text export, or a search snippet.
//!
//! [`plain_text`] is re-exported by `crate::inline` and at the crate
//! root, so both `outl_md::plain_text` and
//! `outl_md::inline::plain_text` keep resolving.

/// Flatten inline markup into the plain text a human reads.
///
/// The single owner of "block text without the syntax". Built for
/// notification bodies — a lock screen showing
/// `ship it [[2026-12-12]] #fup` with the brackets and hash intact
/// reads like a bug — and equally right for any surface that needs the
/// prose without the markers (a11y labels, plain-text export, a search
/// snippet).
///
/// Rules, chosen so the result reads as the author meant it:
///
/// - `[[page]]` and `#tag` keep their name, drop their punctuation.
///   `[[@joão]]` becomes `@joão`: the `@` is part of how the person is
///   written, the brackets are not.
/// - Emphasis (`**bold**`, `_italic_`, `~~strike~~`, `==highlight==`)
///   keeps its contents and drops the markers, recursively.
/// - `[text](url)` keeps the anchor text; the URL is noise out loud.
///   `![alt](url)` keeps the alt for the same reason, and yields
///   nothing when the alt is empty.
/// - `:shortcode:` becomes its glyph, since that's what it renders as.
/// - `((blk-…))` / `!((blk-…))` resolve to nothing here. The handle is
///   an id, not prose, and this function has no index to look it up
///   in — a caller that wants the source text resolves the embed first.

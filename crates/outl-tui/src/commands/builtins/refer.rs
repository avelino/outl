//! `/refer` and `/refer-embed` — capture the current block's ref/embed
//! handle for later paste.
//!
//! These are normal-mode commands (palette `:refer` or slash `/refer`
//! from outside Insert). They do **not** insert into the buffer — they
//! stash `((handle))` / `!((handle))` in `App::last_yanked_ref` and
//! surface the token on the status line so the user can copy it via
//! the terminal's own selection or via a future clipboard binding.
//!
//! Lookup goes through `App::current_block_ref_handle`, which walks
//! the workspace index for the selected `(slug, dfs_path)`. Identical
//! semantics to the `yr` chord; these commands give the same
//! capability a discoverable, typeable name.

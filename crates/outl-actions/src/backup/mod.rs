//! Local, versioned backups of a workspace — the safety net under
//! everything else in this crate.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! outl's durability story is strong in the places it was designed for:
//! the op log is append-only and fsynced, every `.md` write is atomic,
//! and a delete is a move to `TRASH_ROOT` rather than a physical
//! removal. What it had no answer for is the class of failure *outside*
//! that design — a bug in a projection path, a mis-aimed `outl import`
//! over a populated workspace, a sync tool resolving a conflict the
//! wrong way, or a user deleting the wrong page and closing the app
//! (undo is in-memory and dies with the process).
//!
//! For each of those, the recovery story was "reconstruct it by hand
//! from `ops-*.jsonl`". This turns them into `outl backup restore`.
//!
//! ## Why git, and why the `git` binary
//!
//! Git gives content-addressed dedup, a real history, diffs, and
//! restore-to-a-point-in-time for free — on a directory of markdown,
//! which is exactly what git is best at. Writing a bespoke snapshot
//! format to get a worse version of that would be the wrong trade.
//!
//! We shell out to the `git` binary rather than linking `libgit2`
//! because backups must never be a reason `outl-core`'s dependents fail
//! a `cargo deny` audit (see `outl-core/CLAUDE.md` → "This crate's
//! dependency graph is public surface"), and because a workspace backed
//! up by the real `git` stays readable by every tool the user already
//! has. No git on `PATH` degrades to "backups unavailable" — never to a
//! failed edit.
//!
//! ## Where the repository lives: outside the workspace
//!
//! The git directory is **device-local**, under
//! `<outl_core::device_dir()>/backups/<slug>-<hash>.git`, and the
//! workspace is passed as `--work-tree`. Nothing is written inside the
//! workspace — no `.git/`, no `.git` pointer file. Two independent
//! reasons, both of which cost data before this layout:
//!
//! 1. **The workspace is a sync surface.** `.outl/` and everything
//!    beside it ride the file transport on every transport except iCloud
//!    (see `docs/storage.md`). A `.git/` in the workspace root means
//!    Syncthing / Dropbox / a shared NFS mount replicate the object
//!    store, `index`, `HEAD` and `index.lock` between devices under
//!    eventual consistency — a repository corrupted by exactly the
//!    mechanism the per-actor `ops-<actor>.jsonl` layout exists to route
//!    around. A device-local repo is per-device by construction, like
//!    the device store.
//! 2. **`git init` in the workspace root adopted the user's own repo.**
//!    Plenty of people already keep their notes in git. The previous
//!    version detected `<root>/.git` and used it, which meant
//!    `git add --all` clobbered their staging area, the snapshot
//!    committed onto whatever branch they had checked out, their
//!    `pre-commit` hooks ran on every automatic snapshot, and a
//!    `commit.gpgsign = true` wired to 1Password's `op-ssh-sign` turned
//!    each one into a Touch ID prompt that blocked until answered.
//!
//! A separate `--git-dir` gives us a repository we own end to end: our
//! index, our branch, our identity, no hooks (`core.hooksPath` points at
//! a directory that does not exist), no signing, and nothing for a sync
//! client to replicate.
//!
//! A `.git` left inside a workspace by an older build is **not** adopted
//! and **not** deleted — it is the user's directory. [`init`] logs where
//! the new repository lives and leaves it alone.
//!
//! ## What is backed up
//!
//! Everything that is *state*: `ops/` (the source of truth), `pages/`,
//! `journals/`, `templates/`, `assets/`, and `.outl/config.toml`.
//!
//! Not backed up: the caches that are derived and rebuildable —
//! `.outl/snapshots/`, the `.idx` sidecars, lock files, `*.tmp`. Backing
//! those up would bloat every commit with bytes that regenerate on the
//! next boot anyway.
//!
//! **A `.gitignore` in the workspace cannot silence any of that.**
//! Exclusions in the work tree beat `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude`, and a
//! negation there cannot win them back, so a `*.jsonl` line (or a
//! blanket `ops/`) dropped the op log out of every snapshot while
//! `outl backup now` kept printing commit ids and `status` kept
//! reporting a healthy history. The required paths are therefore staged
//! a second time with `git add --force`, and [`BackupRepo::snapshot`]
//! **verifies that every `ops/*.jsonl` on disk is in the resulting
//! commit** before reporting success. A history missing the source of
//! truth is a failure, not a snapshot.
//!
//! ## Automatic snapshots
//!
//! [`spawn_auto_pass`] is the one call a client makes; see the `auto`
//! module for the throttle and the "never on the edit path" rule.

//! The automatic snapshot pass.
//!
//! `[backup] enabled` defaults to **on**, which was a promise nothing
//! kept: [`super::snapshot_best_effort`] had no caller outside its own
//! test, so a user who never ran `outl backup init` by hand had a
//! configuration switch saying "backups are on" and no backups at all.
//! This module is the pass that makes the default true.
//!
//! Three properties it must have, in order:
//!
//! 1. **Never on the edit path.** A snapshot walks the whole workspace
//!    and forks a process; on a large graph that is seconds. It runs on
//!    a background thread ([`spawn_auto_pass`]) so a slow disk can only
//!    ever delay a backup, never a keystroke.
//! 2. **Throttled by the git history, not by a state file.** The floor
//!    between snapshots is derived from the newest commit's timestamp
//!    (`git log -1 --format=%ct`). A separate "last run" file would be
//!    one more thing to keep honest — and one more thing to accidentally
//!    place on the sync surface.
//! 3. **Best-effort, loudly logged.** Every failure lands in a `warn!`
//!    and returns `None`.
//!
//! The pass also **creates the repository on first run**. That is safe
//! precisely because the repository is device-local and outside the
//! workspace (see the parent module): auto-initialising cannot surprise
//! a user by turning their notes folder into a git repo, and without it
//! `enabled = true` would still mean "nothing happens until you run a
//! command you have not heard of".

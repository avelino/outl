//! Serialize a selection of blocks to clean outl markdown for the clipboard.
//!
//! This is the **inverse** of [`crate::paste::paste_markdown`] (which is
//! itself a thin wrapper over [`outl_md::parse::parse`]): copy a subtree
//! out, paste it back into outl, and the same tree is reconstructed. The
//! two ship as a pair so the round-trip is testable (`markdown-roundtrip-tester`).
//!
//! Every client wraps [`copy_markdown`]; nobody re-implements outline
//! serialization in client code. The TUI writes the result to the OS
//! clipboard on `yy` / `Y` / visual `y` (in addition to its in-memory
//! yank register); the desktop and mobile clients call it from their
//! copy handlers via a shared Tauri command.
//!
//! The core only ever produces the **canonical** outl markdown. Other
//! output formats (plain text, org-mode, HTML, …) are the domain of
//! optional format plugins, not this module — see
//! `docs/design/clipboard.md`.

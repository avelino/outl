/**
 * Inline auto-complete helpers for the block editor.
 *
 * Two related concerns live here:
 *
 * 1. **Pair completion**: when the user types the second `[` to form
 *    `[[`, or the second `(` to form `((`, we proactively insert the
 *    matching `]]` / `))` to the right of the caret and keep the
 *    caret in the middle. Same trick most editors use for quotes and
 *    brackets — saves the user typing the closing pair when their
 *    intent is unambiguous.
 *
 * 2. **Context detection**: while the caret sits *inside* an open
 *    `[[…]]` or `((…))` we can offer a suggestion list (pages for
 *    refs, blocks for block refs). [`detectRefContext`] reads the
 *    text around the caret and returns the kind + the current query
 *    if we're in that state.
 *
 * Both helpers are pure functions over the textarea string + caret
 * index, so they're trivial to unit-test and they make no assumption
 * about the DOM.
